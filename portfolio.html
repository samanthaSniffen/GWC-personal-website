    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <h4>I've done a number of different things, but I'm mostly going to talk about the Cyber related ones here.</h4>
    <h4>Last summer I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. It was so much fun! I learned lot about coding websites, and it was great to meet other girls with similar interests. I coded two projects there: a personal website like this one (<a href="https://personal-site-sami.samisniffen.repl.co">My Personal Website</a>), and a personality quiz (<a href="https://book-quiz-sami.samisniffen.repl.co">Book Quiz</a>).</h4>
    <h4>This year I'm participating in the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Summer Program. So far I've made two chat bots (<a href="https://replit.com/@samiSniffen/CyHelp-Chatbot#main.py">CyHelp Chatbot</a>, and <a href="https://replit.com/@samiSniffen/Breach-Bot">Breach Bot</a>), and this is my third project. After this is making personality quizzes, and an activist website. (<a href="https://gwc-self-paced-program-quiz.samisniffen.repl.co/index.html">Personality Quizzes</a>, <a href="https://online-safety.samisniffen.repl.co/index.html">Online Safety</a>)</h4>
    <h4>As a part of a team that competed in the 2020-2021 season in Cyberpatriot, we got 3rd place in Georgia. There was a news article about us, and we got an incredible opportunity. (<a href="https://www.army.mil/article/247479/army_cyber_command_salutes_local_student_teams_for_winning_cybersecurity_skills">Army Cyber Command salutes local student teams for winning cybersecurity skills</a>) I also competed in the 2019-2020 season, but we didn't do as well then. </h4>
    <h4>This year, I will be competing again with a Civil Air Patrol squadron. I am super excited!!!</h4>
    <h4>Another competition I have competed in, is Cyberstart America (<a href="https://www.cyberstartamerica.org/">CyberStart America</a>). It is a wonderful program, and has taught me alot over the years. I have competed in it for about 3 years now. I was a National Cyber Scholership Finalist in both 2021 and 2022. I am looking forward to competing this year for the last time.</h4>
